# 📘 **Dynamic NAT with a Pool — Cisco Packet Tracer (Scenario 2)**

### *Inside LAN via MLS SVI → NAT Edge Router → ISP Simulation*

This lab demonstrates **Dynamic NAT using a public IP address pool**, allowing multiple internal hosts to access external networks through a range of available global addresses. Unlike static NAT, dynamic NAT allocates public IPs **only when traffic is initiated** and releases them when sessions expire. This scenario builds directly on the previous Static NAT setup, using the same multilayer switch and NAT edge router topology.

---

## 🏗 **1. Lab Topology Overview**

This scenario uses the same network design as Scenario 1:

* **Multilayer Switch (MLS)** as the default gateway using an SVI
* **R1** as the NAT edge router performing Dynamic NAT
* **ISP Router** representing the external network
* **Inside hosts** located in VLAN 20

Traffic flow:

```
[Inside Hosts] → [MLS SVI] → [R1 NAT] → [ISP Router] → "Internet"
```

Dynamic NAT assigns public IPs from a pool:

```
Pool Range: 209.165.200.227 – 209.165.200.229
```

This allows internal hosts to receive temporary public IPs as needed.

## ⚙️ **3. Configuration Summary**

Dynamic NAT requires three components:

1. **NAT Pool** – defines the range of public IPs
2. **ACL** – matches internal traffic eligible for NAT
3. **NAT Rule** – binds the ACL to the pool

---

### **Multilayer Switch (MLS)**

No changes from Scenario 1. The MLS continues routing inside traffic and forwarding to R1.

```bash
ip routing

interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
 no shut

interface g0/1
 no switchport
 ip address 192.168.30.2 255.255.255.252
 no shut

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.30.1
```

---

### **R1 – NAT Edge Router (Dynamic NAT Pool)**

Add the following to the existing NAT configuration from Scenario 1:

```bash
! Define the NAT pool
ip nat pool dynamicpool 209.165.200.227 209.165.200.229 netmask 255.255.255.248

! Match inside traffic leaving toward the ISP
access-list 10 permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255

! Bind ACL 10 to the pool
ip nat inside source list 10 pool NAT-POOL
```

Interface configuration remains:

```bash
interface g0/1
 ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.252
 ip nat inside

interface g0/0
 ip address 209.165.200.225 255.255.255.248
 ip nat outside
```

Routing configuration:

```bash
ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.30.2
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.200.230
```

---

### **ISP Router**

```bash
interface g0/0
 ip address 209.165.200.230 255.255.255.248
 no shut

ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 209.165.200.225
```

---

## 🧪 **4. Verification Steps**

### **1. Test outbound traffic from inside PC1**

From PC1:

```bash
ping 209.165.200.230
```

On R1:

```bash
show ip nat translations
```

Expected entry:

```
192.168.20.10   →   209.165.200.227
```

---

### **2. Test outbound traffic from inside PC2**

From PC2:

```bash
ping 209.165.200.230
```

Back on R1:

```
192.168.20.20   →   209.165.200.228
192.168.20.10   →   209.165.200.227
```

This confirms that:

* Each host receives a unique public IP
* NAT addresses are allocated dynamically from the pool

---

### **3. Traceroute from the inside PC**

From PC1 or PC2:

```bash
tracert 209.165.200.230
```

Expected path:

```
PC → 192.168.20.1 (MLS) → 192.168.30.1 (R1 NAT) → 209.165.200.230 (ISP)
```

---

### **4. Optional: Test pool exhaustion**

If you add a 4th inside host:

Only **three** hosts receive pool translations.
The 4th will fail to translate because:

```
Pool size = 3 IPs
```

This is excellent for demonstration purposes.
