Switching Labs Portfolio
This folder contains a growing collection of enterprise-oriented switching labs designed to demonstrate practical understanding of Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching concepts commonly encountered in production networks.

Each lab emphasizes design intent, operational behavior, and troubleshooting logic rather than rote configuration. The goal is to reflect how switching technologies are planned, deployed, validated, and maintained in real environments.

🎯 Objectives
These labs are built to:

Reinforce switching fundamentals with practical examples
Demonstrate real-world topology behavior and recovery
Explore routing and switching interactions (Layer 2 to Layer 3)
Practice design thinking and validation skills
Align with CCNA/CCNP foundations
✅ Completed Labs
🌀 STP – Spanning Tree Protocol
Demonstrates the role of STP in preventing loops and enabling failover at Layer 2.

Key Topics:

Root bridge election
Port states (forwarding/blocking)
Path cost and priority tuning
Convergence and redundancy behavior
🌐 VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
Implements a segmented network with multiple VLANs and inter-VLAN routing using a router with subinterfaces.

Key Topics:

VLAN creation and assignment
Trunk vs access ports
802.1Q encapsulation
Subinterface design and default gateway roles
🧭 Lab Design Philosophy
All labs follow these principles:

Intent-Driven: Designs explain why the setup exists
Troubleshooting-Aware: Labs include failure tests and recovery validation
Enterprise-Realistic: Topologies are scalable, not just certification-focused
Documentation-First: Each lab folder includes a README.md outlining goals and verification strategy
🧰 Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
GNS3 with Cisco IOS images
Virtual hosts for testing
Wireshark (when applicable)
Tool selection depends on lab complexity and simulation needs.
