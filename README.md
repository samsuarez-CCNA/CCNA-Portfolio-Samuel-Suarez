# 🧰 CCNA Lab Portfolio – Built in GNS3 & Cisco Packet Tracer
Welcome! I’m **Samuel Suarez** — an IT professional, building my way into network engineering & cybersecurity through hands-on labs.

This repository is my hands-on CCNA portfolio, showcasing:

- Configuration skills (switching, routing, security)
- Troubleshooting ability (broken → fixed labs)
- Documentation habits (configs, screenshots, markdown)
- Network design (home labs with pfSense, VMware, and Cisco Packet Tracer) 
---

## 🔹 Lab Categories

### **🔸 Switching Labs** 
- VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing
 Configure VLANs, router-on-a-stick, and troubleshoot common issues.
- STP  
### **🔸 Routing Labs** 
- Static & Dynamic Routing (OSPF focus) Showcases subnetting, route advertisement, and path selection.
### **🔸 Security Labs**
- ACLs – Traffic filtering and access control.
- NAT/PAT – IP translation for WAN/Internet access.
### **🔸 Troubleshooting Scenarios**
- Troubleshooting
- Intentionally broken labs to demonstrate diagnosis + repair process.
### **🔸 Complete Network Designs**
- Enterprise Networks
- Realistic design with segmentation, DHCP/DNS, and firewall zones.

## 🎯 Why This Portfolio Matters
Employers don’t just want certifications — they want proof of real-world, hands-on capability.
This repo shows:

- **Configuration fluency** (raw configs + guides)
- **Troubleshooting process** (broken/fixed labs)
- **Documentation habit**s (markdown + screenshots)
- **Initiative:** building labs without physical routers/switches

_📌 Built with GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer, VMware, VPCS, pfSense, and open-source tools._
